Store Sales and Profit Analysis Project
Overview
This project analyzes sales and profit trends to help businesses improve their operations, pricing, marketing, and inventory management strategies. The goal was to identify patterns in sales and profit on a monthly, category, and sub-category basis. Additionally, we calculated the Sales to Profit Ratio for each segment to measure profitability and efficiency.

What Was Done
Data Preparation:
Cleaned and formatted the raw sales and profit data for analysis.
Created new metrics, like the TOTAL SALES, TOTAL PROFIT, PROFIT MARGIN, and TOTAL QUANTITY using DAX queries, to better understand business performance.

Analysis:
Examined trends in Sales and Profit monthly.
Broke down performance by Category and Sub-Category to see which products or areas are driving the most revenue.
